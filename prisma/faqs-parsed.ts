    "question": "What if my school or parish is too small for an in-person book fair?",
    "answer": "<p>Ignatius Book Fairs &nbsp;offers a virtual book fair. These are ideal for smaller schools. This event requires much less volunteer time and effort to organize. This option is available to larger schools too if they don’t want to host a full onsite book fair. </p><p><strong>Is there a minimum sales requirement? </strong></p><p>We ask that you feel confident that you have enough community support to generate at least $1000 in sales, although there is no minimum requirement. </p><p><strong>How much does a Virtual Book Fair cost? </strong></p><p>The cost is $175, which includes all the books, supplies, and customer support you need for a successful event. Payment must be received within 15 days of signing the contract.</p><p><strong>What do you send us? </strong></p><p>One week before your virtual fair begins, each organization will be sent an official virtual book fair kit. The kit will include 50 book fair flyers, 50 bookmarks, and the selection of our most popular, best-selling books you opted to receive. You may keep these books OR re-sell them at list price after your virtual book fair concludes.</p><p><strong>How are books purchased? </strong></p><p>All the shopping is done entirely on our website, store.ignatiusbookfairs.com and payment is by credit card. Customers simply create an online account, select your school, and start shopping! </p><p>NOTE: After your online book fair ends, if you choose to re-sell the sample books, your organization is responsible for accepting payment via check, cash, FACTS, etc.</p><p><strong>Do you offer rewards for our organization?</strong></p><p>Yes! Your organization will earn “Ave Dollars” which can be redeemed on our website to buy books. We offer 30% of all online sales (excluding tax) in Ave Dollars if your sales exceed $3,000. Here's an example of what you can earn:</p><p><strong>30% Ave Dollars&nbsp;</strong></p><p>$1000&nbsp;earns $300&nbsp;Ave Dollars</p><p>$2000&nbsp;earns $600&nbsp;Ave Dollars&nbsp;</p><p>$3000&nbsp;earns $900&nbsp;Ave Dollars&nbsp;</p><p>Over $3000 earns $900 + $75 in Surprise Bonus Books&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br><br>How long will our online book fair last? </strong></p><p>The online book fair will last 7 days.

Your organization is responsible for distributing these books. </p><p><strong>What work is required from our organization? </strong></p><p>Your main role will be to advertise your event using all the communications your organization sends out: newsletters, social media posts, parish bulletin, in the official calendar, etc. It’s best practice to advertise often leading up to the fair, then each day during the fair. To make this easy, we provide a comprehensive set of advertising resources. If your community doesn’t know about the fair, or forgets that it is happening, they won’t order! Advertising ideas will be talked about during our live workshop for virtual fairs. Please plan to sign up to attend when you receive the invitation. You will be sent the recording even if you were not able to make it to the session.</p><p><strong>How do we advertise? </strong></p><p>We will send you a digital kit with social media graphics, a wish list, a digital catalog and instructions on how to use them. We will also be talking a lot about advertising during our live workshop, which is built especially for our virtual fair coordinators.</p><p><strong>What do we do after the online book fair ends? </strong></p><p>We will notify you about your total online sales and add the Ave Dollars to your account, so you can start using the rewards you have earned!</p><p><strong>How do we schedule a “Virtual Book Fair”?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ignatiusbookfairs.com.\">Contact a Book Fair Pro</a></p>",
